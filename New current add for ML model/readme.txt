This is the readme for the code for the paper:
Zijian Zhang and Danny Liu
Investigating impact of tonic-clonic
seizure transition by adding
additional current

These files are from Zijian Zhang and Danny Liu.

Usage:

Included is the code for running the Tonic-clonic simulation with synaptic depression
(ML_depress_sim.m) and the code for running the many network
simulations (ML_Net_Sweep.m) without synaptic depression. In addition, the user will need the
derivative file (ML_derivs.m).
