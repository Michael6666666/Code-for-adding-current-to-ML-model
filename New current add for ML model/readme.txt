This is the readme for the code for the Math 568 project, with original code from Beverlin 2011

Usage:

Included is the code for running the Tonic-clonic simulation with synaptic depression
(ML_depress_sim.m) and the code for running the many network
simulations (ML_Net_Sweep.m) without synaptic depression. In addition, the user will need the
derivative file (ML_derivs.m).
